    # once it receives it, it stores it in the entered_todo variable. Session state creates an program in respect of the key given to it in the square
    # brackets. The Syntax is the same as above. First the program will be empty with the variable assigned. Once the user enters the input in the
    # input box, such as our case, the program stores the user's todo to the variable assigned.
    # even if you give a key of an title function, or an write function, the program takes in the value given to the title or write function and stores it
    # in the assigned variable.
